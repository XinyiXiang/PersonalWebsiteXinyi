# Genre Treasure Hunt
## Features

- All these instructions have either a picture shown the physical product or image drawn to help users comprehend the usage procedures.
- The instructions typically follow a streamline process, in other words, actions are put into steps.
- The information is composed of different parts with a title summarizing the main content of each paragraph or paragraphs.
- All instructions have included the product either on part of the pages or all pages.
- All examples have included their contact for further inquiries.

## Unique things from each example

- A: Nexus 7 Guidebook included a content page summary for all the sub portions with the rest of the instructions.
- B: AKG BX-25E included the physical product picture for more than one perspective.
- C: GriGri-1 included different languages of instruction.
- D: RotaryPhone included the specifics on packaging for returning the product.


The genre we are introduced to this week are instruction guidebooks, they are typically written in concise, instructive languages and include images alongside with texts for clear indications. To adapt to a wider user base, some instructions have chosen to translate the instructions into more languages widely spoken by people around the world. To resolve further confusion or ambiguity, many of these instructions have included a contact phone number for users to dial in, this way the users can get more assistance with assembling or using the product.

All the example products implemented a certain technology, including but not limited to smart phones, audio reverberation unit, rotary phone and safety ropes. For the Nexus 7 smartphone, the instructions mostly focused on software usage and visualized functionalities. Then both the audio reverberation unit and rotary phone have included essential details within a shorter passage length. Since the plugs on the unit are on different facets of the product, the manufacturer actually included an image from each direction the user might need. The rotary phone had included a detailed instruction on returning the product as part of their quality guarantee, from a consumer’s perspective, this could be used to show the confidence of their product from the manufacturer. Lastly, when examining the GriGri safety rope, it is not hard to see the product tried to make their product inclusive for people speaking different languages, and the reasons behind is self-explainable, the product can be used in situations that would potentially protect users from harms and the manufacturer certainly do not want be responsible for any harm incurred because the users were not able to read and understand the instruction manual. 

Noticeably with the text instructions, these steps guide users in usually a progressive approach. The beginning typically introduces the parts of products to the users, and then moves on to discuss how to assemble the small things for complicated behaviors. Sometimes, each specific step might be composed of more complex sub-steps, and writers would then create a descriptive title summarizing related steps, and compose the smaller steps into a more detailed paragraph.

# Personal Statement


I have always been interested in optimizing math models with computers. Over the summer after high school, I interned at a company designing for an early-warning traffic analysis system. While researching with the team, I generated refined neural networks to classify image data, by connecting my implementations and numerical analysis theories, I saw from this experience where math helps people outside of the scope I was familiar with it in. At the time, I was familiar mostly with calculus and probability related, but the internship allowed me to create and build structures directly representing real-life connections.


Then in MATH 308, when I was re-introduced to some of the concepts, I felt at ease to visualize how the matrices get transformed to the desired results. In reverse, class materials substantiated my understanding of the internship work. At UW, I took at least one math related course per quarter, and audited at courses if permitted. The summer quarter was accelerated but also very resourceful, my instructor provided me with helpful insights on how to approach certain proofs, which served my math studies even more than the differential techniques did. Then I took multivariable calculus with Dr.Bhattacharya, some of the physics theorems and properties I learned a year ago got clarified in their mathematical forms in this course, especially with curl and divergence, I felt inspiring performing the computations with the knowledge of math concepts to construct the models. Math’s beauty shows not only when it crosses areas, but also when generations of people attempt to patternize its transformation.
The math department has always been supportive, as I plan to further my studies in grad school at UW, I wish to influence my peers and new students like the people who helped me along the way. I would firmly hold onto the opportunities math offers to study on the fundamental reasonings behind the implementations, and prepare for concentrating in optimizations.

# Key Reasons to Include Selected Pieces


I chose to include these five pieces of writings from this quarter because they taught me the most valuable lessons from examining the original pieces to revising for a version that conveys my ideas better. With the infographic, I learned about the appropriate word choices for a certain group of audience, and writing while always have my audiences in heart. Then for Genre Treasure Hunt, I found that even within the same genre of writing, there remains identifiable nuances in the extent of context and formats between short manuals and detailed instruction sets. Markdown Manifesto adapted to the markdown language guidelines in the interests of formatting one’s ideas more efficiently. And then for the Press Release, I learned to write in consideration for both direct and indirect stakeholders among the audiences, beyond just thinking as a writer. My writings also represent the companies for which the statements were written for. Only at the end of the journey this quarter’s technical writing course has provided, have I realized the assignments are progressively helping us to practice putting each elements we learned together, and eventually, moving to write something that is personal to us which transforms non-colloquial statements into appropriate formats. Of course, everything is based on the consumption that we write both for the audiences and ourselves.
