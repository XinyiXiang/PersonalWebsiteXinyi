The genre we are introduced to this week are instruction guidebooks, they are typically written in concise, instructive languages and include images alongside with texts for clear indications. To adapt to a wider user base, some instructions have chosen to translate the instructions into more languages widely spoken by people around the world. To resolve further confusion or ambiguity, many of these instructions have included a contact phone number for users to dial in, this way the users can get more assistance with assembling or using the product.

All the example products implemented a certain technology, including but not limited to smart phones, audio reverberation unit, rotary phone and safety ropes. For the Nexus 7 smartphone, the instructions mostly focused on software usage and visualized functionalities. Then both the audio reverberation unit and rotary phone have included essential details within a shorter passage length. Since the plugs on the unit are on different facets of the product, the manufacturer actually included an image from each direction the user might need. The rotary phone had included a detailed instruction on returning the product as part of their quality guarantee, from a consumerâ€™s perspective, this could be used to show the confidence of their product from the manufacturer. Lastly, when examining the GriGri safety rope, it is not hard to see the product tried to make their product inclusive for people speaking different languages, and the reasons behind is self-explainable, the product can be used in situations that would potentially protect users from harms and the manufacturer certainly do not want be responsible for any harm incurred because the users were not able to read and understand the instruction manual. 

Noticeably with the text instructions, these steps guide users in usually a progressive approach. The beginning typically introduces the parts of products to the users, and then moves on to discuss how to assemble the small things for complicated behaviors. Sometimes, each specific step might be composed of more complex sub-steps, and writers would then create a descriptive title summarizing related steps, and compose the smaller steps into a more detailed paragraph.
